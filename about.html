        <p class="lead">
            Hi there! I'm a sophomore @Stanford studying Materials Science Engineering and Computer Science.
            I'm particularly interested in both studying and characterizing novel materials in technology and
            in coding projects that have the potential for high social impact. I'm passionate about projects
            regarding the intersection of innovative technology, sustainability, and resource allocation/equity.

                    Welcome to my page! I created this during the Coronavirus Pandemic season as a way to learn new
                    skills and to document my already completed projects and pursuits.
                    Learning Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS has been a really great experience and something very different
                    from what school teaches, and I'm very excited
                    to continuously improve upon both Front-End and Back-End capabilities. Let me know if there are any
                    suggestions on how to improve the page.

                            I shoot Barebow on Stanford's collegiate archery team! The team is comprised of Stanford
                            undergraduates and graduate students under the direction
                            of former U.S. national team member Francis Parchaso. Stanford Archery is a recreational
                            club sport with a mission to do its competitive best, bring safe
                            archery to the community, and to have fun. I currently serve as the Recruiting Director and
                            enjoy talking about the club and onboarding new recruits!
                            I didn't shoot before coming to Stanford, but learning has been very fun, and the community
                            is really relaxed. We shoot every Sunday on the Stanford Range
                            and have member practices every single weekday. Although I'm still a terrible shot, I enjoy
                            cracking bad archery puns, grabbing
                            meals after practice, and gawking over the accuracy of some of the deadshots on the team.

                            Dragonboating is an exciting water sport with historical roots in Chinese
                            folklore in which 22-person boats compete in races ranging 200m to 8km. Stanford Dragonboat
                            is a recreational team affiliated with
                            the California Dragonboat Association (CDBA), and we compete year-round in races around the
                            West Coast against schools such as UC Berkeley,
                            Cal State schools, and San Francisco University, among other schools. I was first introduced
                            to Dragonboating by my dad as the local Chinese
                            church participated in Lake Lanier rowing competitions, complete with exciting festivals
                            packed with observers, street food, and Chinese crafts.
                            The Dragonboating commununity at Stanford is very friendly, and rowing is a great way to
                            destress after a stacked week of classes.
                            On Saturday mornings, we wake up and drive in Zipcars to a local waterway where we paddle
                            and splash water all over the person in front of us to
                            the rhythm of shouts or a drum. After practice, we ALWAYS make sure to grab food, be it
                            In-and-Out, Pho, Hotpot, Dumplings, or Boba. It's a great
                            way to spend Saturdays--putting on calories from eating with friends after burning them on a
                            workout--and I love that I get a chance to get off-campus!

                        Common Origins is Stanford's largest non-audition dance group. I joined CO in
                        Winter Quarter after showing up to one of their workshops recommended by a friend, and
                        I really enjoyed the energy and enthusiasm of the group. Dancing was new to me, but CO
                        is extremely new dancer friendly, and the COre team really works hard to include everyone
                        in their hip-hop style. Each quarter, there's a set of choreographers that take the lead for
                        individual pieces, andfor performances, dancers can pick to dance in as many pieces as they
                        want.
                        Thus, the pieces range in different styles based on the choreographer, which is really nice.
                        I danced to choreo to artists ranging from NIKI to Halsey to Joyner Lucas.
                        I really love the support, warmth, and energy of CO (best described as wholesome), and it
                        really comes out in workshops, practices,
                        and dance parties (which are SO much fun and way better than normal parties--if you haven't
                        been
                        to a dancer party, you haven't lived)
                        Common Origins performs at events such as Breaking Ground (the first large dance event that
                        historically
                        CO organizes), EnCounter Culture (ECC), and Family Weekend, and it's quite exhilirating to
                        dance
                        in front of hundreds of people alongside really supportive team members.
